# 📧 Email Automation Tool

This is a project I built to practice **email automation** in Python.  
It features a **simple and modern GUI** using the `customtkinter` library.

## 🚀 What It Can Do

- 📥 Add and remove email addresses
- 📝 Edit the email **subject** and **message content**
- 📤 Automatically send the message to all addresses listed in a `.csv` file

## 🖥️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **customtkinter** (for the GUI)
- **CSV** (to store email addresses)
- **smtplib** (for sending emails)

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Load or create a CSV file containing the email addresses
2. Use the GUI to:
   - Add/remove emails from the list
   - Edit the message subject and body
3. Click "Send" to submit the message to all recipients in the list automatically
